                                Right out of my USC Undergraduate as a business major, I worked as an logistics manager, an accountant, and ended up with mortgage industry. I have been a mortgage underwriter for the past 8 years successfully achieving a lot of respect from many of the people I worked with and deeply rooting my networks amongst the mortgage professionals. <br></br><br></br> However, I realized my passion was really in making things better and more efficient. I decided to take the time needed to get into a bootcamp to learn coding and start my new chapter in life to be a better contributor to the world we live in.<br></br><br></br>
                                As a father of two (one being a dog, Coco) and a husband of a beautiful wife, I have grown to love coding and problem solving. Let us connect and expand our world together!<br></br><br></br> I also love playing tennis!ðŸ˜œ
